## What is Dat?

Dat is a new peer to peer protocol for building apps of the future.
Building on the design of Bittorrent, Git, and other technologies, Dat creates new possibilities for data-rich applications. Dat efficiently syncs & versions data across a distributed network.

## Start Building

Dat's open source ecosystem makes it easy to build apps on top of Dat or contribute to the Dat core. Learn more:
